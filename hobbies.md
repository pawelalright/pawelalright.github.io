## Music

Before relocating to Brazil, I <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFAR_xIx7rk" target="_blank" markdown="0">played the guitar</a> in <a markdown="0" href="http://indicaoficial.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Indica</a>, a psychedelic indie rock band from Buenos Aires, which is currently finishing their <a markdown="0" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wnjNq6JovY">third studio album</a> in which I play in. 

Before that, I've been in different nice bands playing guitar, keyboards and synths. (I even had a <a markdown="0" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiqSuhgMTuE" target="_blank">tribute band!</a>)

Nowadays I'm slowly putting together my own projects like <a href="https://soundcloud.com/pwlmusic" target="_blank" markdown="0">PWL</a>(with an <a markdown="0" target="_blank" href="http://pablofabregat.bandcamp.com/">old experimental album</a>) and a nameless folk project on his way.

## Photography

I've always been <a markdown="0" href="http://pfabregat.deviantart.com/gallery/" target="_blank">passionate about photography</a>, but I've recently bought a good camera and I've started a proper <a markdown="0" href="http://behance.net/pablitt/" target="_blank">photography profile</a> where I experiment with different techniques, settings and lenses. And, of course, my cats.

## Exercising

There is not much to say about this one, <a target="_blank" markdown="0" href="http://runkeeper.com/user/pablitt/profile">I love running</a> and cycling!. I also love Basketball, but I don't play as much as I'd like :)
