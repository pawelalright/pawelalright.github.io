## A short story about it

My first approach to computers was when I was six years old, someone introduced me to The Prince of Persia and I was instantly hooked. From that moment on, every time I was near a computer, I took advantage of the situation and started messing with things, modifying stuff, playing with files, customizing everything(and almost every time, the owners of those PCs complained about it :P), and so on. 

Later on, by cosmic chance, someone gave me a PC as a gift, and the party got started. First getting my hands on different software(5Â¼" diskettes FTW!), trying out everything, and then I moved to disassembling and assembling the computer again, several times(most of them failed :P). It was a really great game for me, and then, when I was finishing primary school, my best friend's brother gave me a programming book with the following words coming out of his mouth: _now the game will get really interesting for you_. It was a Pascal programming book. The game got interesting indeed.

And ever since then I've spent all my high school learning how to be a developer(and having several summer jobs thanks to that!). I went from Pascal to Basic, Visual Basic, Delphi, C and even some assembler in the middle. And by the time I was finishing high school, I became obsessed with web technologies(by that time, PHP4 was in all its glory). Then I got my first _real_ job.

## What I learnt

Since I started working I learnt lots of different skills, technologies, and even languages(I'm currently learning Dutch and French, and before that I learnt Portuguese). I've worked on different companies and as a freelancer, so I've managed to achieve an interesting list:

### As a developer

I've attained strong developing skills in **PHP, HTML, JS, CSS, Python, Bash and C++**
For databases: MySQL, Oracle, MSSQL and PostgreSQL.
I've also developed strong skills with content management platform systems like Drupal.

### As a software architect and technical leader

In the past five or six years, I've developed a solid knowledge on how to lead small and big teams using agile methodologies. Also I am big lover of code reviews and re-factoring :D 

Abstracting the complexity of a system, designing and developing a project's architectural foundation, making the project capacity plan, keeping control over the architecture life cycle, support to the development team, supporting client and business activities, and so on.

### As a sysAdmin

I have a strong solid knowledge on the following areas: LAMP servers and all the related infrastructure, managing extensive git/svn repositories, improving productivity by designing(or re-designing) and implementing internal continuous integration processes(jenkins, Acquia network administration, Amazon network administration, etc).
