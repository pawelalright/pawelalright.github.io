So a year ago I've done a freelance drupal job, you know, the kind of quick-and-dirty-money-freelance-job that you completely wipe of your memory after is done, and it came back to bite my ass, no surprises there. So I needed to change some stuff over here and fix other over there, that  

A quick word about Drupal on Dreamhost: *don't*, really, _don't do it_. The Dreamhost shared servers are *so* overselled that are completely drained of resources. So if you don't want to have a painfull experience with a CMS like Drupal, Wordpress, Joomla, whatever-thing-that-uses-lots-of-tables, just don't hire them.
