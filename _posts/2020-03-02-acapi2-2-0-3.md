It's been a long road but we're finally on track. The library has been out of beta for a while and it keeps growing.

<!--more-->

This [new version of acapi2](https://pypi.org/project/acapi2/) already comes with support for notifications (since **2.0.2**).

Whenever an action is executed (e.g. a [code import](https://cloudapi-docs.acquia.com/#/Environments/postEnvironmentsImportSite)), the API will return a uuid for its correspondent task status (notification), this can be used to check on the status of the task itself"

```python
notif_uuid = "d82a122d-b7b8-46fc-9999-39cb824fac8d"
notification = acquia.notification(notif_uuid)
print(notification.data)
```

You can also check on the [current notifications for a specific application](https://cloudapi-docs.acquia.com/#/Applications/getApplicationNotifications):

```python
filters = "name=@*myapp*"
app = acquia.applications(filters=filters).first()

notifications = app.notifications()
for uuid, notification in notifications.items():
        print(notification.data)
```

Thanks to the amazing open source community, other features have been added to this release.

* Logs Forwarding (@yogingale)
* Backups,
* Wait until a notification is done (@NastHoloviz),
* Retry via the backoff lib (@dmitry-kiselev-light-it),
* The task endpoints are being removed, since they're deprecated in the API (you should be using notifications instead!),
* Support for environment variables `ACQUIA_CLOUD_API_KEY` and `ACQUIA_CLOUD_API_SECRET`; how the credentials are provided to the library is responsibility of the user.

I'll try to add more information and credits in future versions.
